        <p>With the shift from traditional software to more web applications, students built fully functional CRUD applications using HTML, CSS with Bootstrap, and HTMX for the frontend, and Python with Flask for the backend.</p>
<p>In the spring, approximately eight students worked on developing an open-source software project designed to replace the current PREP-KC database and volunteer management system. Students have been busy all spring building, and we are excited to showcase a usable demo below.</p>

                    <h5>Nickname: Polaris</h5>
                    <p>The Connector platform is PREP-KC's virtual platform for connecting classrooms with volunteers both locally and nationally. During the 2023-2024 year, we supported over 300 classrooms with 228 unique presenters.</p>
                    <p>Pathways to Tech students assisted us in developing a tool to track sessions in our districts, which can be shared with the entire team and will serve as the foundation for our volunteer management overhaul over the next year.</p>
                    <p>Students were involved in every step of the process, from the planning stages and database schema creation to building the backend and frontend, testing, and making adjustments based on feedback. They learned how to contribute to a real project and saw their code used in production.</p>
